I AM GOING TO CREATE A nodejs application, what are the items i need to add in the docker container?
##########################################################################################
Creating a Docker container for a Node.js application involves including all the necessary components to ensure that the app runs smoothly in a consistent environment. Hereâ€™s a checklist of items you typically need to include:
Node.js: Your Docker container needs Node.js installed. You can use an official Node.js image from Docker Hub as a base image.
Application Code: Your Node.js application code, including all the source files.
Package Files:
package.json: This file contains metadata about your project and lists dependencies.
package-lock.json (or yarn.lock if you use Yarn): This file locks the versions of the dependencies.
Environment Variables: Any environment-specific configurations should be handled using environment variables. You can manage these using Docker's -e flag or a .env file.
Dependencies: Ensure that all Node.js dependencies are installed by running npm install or yarn install.
Build Scripts: If your application requires a build step (like for TypeScript, Babel, or bundling with Webpack), ensure these steps are executed in the Dockerfile.
Configuration Files: Any configuration files needed by your application, such as .env, config.json, etc.
Dockerfile: This file defines the steps to build your Docker image.

Here's a more complete Dockerfile with some of these considerations:
####################################################################
# Use the official Node.js image from the Docker Hub
FROM node:18

# Create a non-root user and use it to run the app
RUN useradd -m myuser
USER myuser

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY --chown=myuser:myuser . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
